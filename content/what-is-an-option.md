What is an Option?
Welcome to the first step in your options trading journey! Before we dive into strategies, we need to understand the fundamental building block: the option itself.

The "No Obligation" Contract
At its core, an option is a financial contract. It gives the person who buys it the right, but critically, not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset (like a stock) at a predetermined price on or before a specific date.

Think of it like a coupon for a grocery store:

The coupon gives you the right to buy a can of soup for $1.

You are not obligated to buy the soup. You can let the coupon expire.

The coupon has an expiration date.

The $1 price is a predetermined price.

In the world of trading, this structure provides incredible flexibility, which is why traders love options.

Key Components of Every Option
Every option contract has a few key pieces of information you'll need to know:

Underlying Asset: The stock, ETF, or index the option is based on (e.g., Apple stock, ticker: AAPL).

Type: Is it a Call (the right to buy) or a Put (the right to sell)? We'll cover this in the next lesson.

Strike Price: The predetermined price at which you can buy or sell the stock.

Expiration Date: The date the contract becomes void.

Premium: The price you pay to buy the option contract.

Why Do People Use Options?
Traders use options for two primary reasons:

Speculation: To make a leveraged bet on the future direction of a stock's price. Because options are cheaper than the stock itself, the potential percentage returns (and losses) can be much higher.

Hedging: To protect their existing portfolio. For example, if you own 100 shares of a stock, you could buy a put option to protect yourself against a potential price drop.
