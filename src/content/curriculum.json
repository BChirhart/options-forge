              "textContent": "Welcome to the first step in your options trading journey! Before we dive into strategies, we need to understand the fundamental building block: the option itself.\n\nThe \"No Obligation\" Contract\n\nAt its core, an option is a financial contract. It gives the person who buys it the right, but critically, not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset (like a stock) at a predetermined price on or before a specific date.\n\nThink of it like a coupon for a grocery store:\n\n• The coupon gives you the right to buy a can of soup for $1.\n• You are not obligated to buy the soup. You can let the coupon expire.\n• The coupon has an expiration date.\n• The $1 price is a predetermined price.\n\nIn the world of trading, this structure provides incredible flexibility, which is why traders love options.\n\nKey Components of Every Option\n\nEvery option contract has a few key pieces of information you'll need to know:\n\n• Underlying Asset: The stock, ETF, or index the option is based on (e.g., Apple stock, ticker: AAPL).\n• Type: Is it a Call (the right to buy) or a Put (the right to sell)? We'll cover this in the next lesson.\n• Strike Price: The predetermined price at which you can buy or sell the stock.\n• Expiration Date: The date the contract becomes void.\n• Premium: The price you pay to buy the option contract.\n\nWhy Do People Use Options?\n\nTraders use options for two primary reasons:\n\nSpeculation: To make a leveraged bet on the future direction of a stock's price. Because options are cheaper than the stock itself, the potential percentage returns (and losses) can be much higher.\n\nHedging: To protect their existing portfolio. For example, if you own 100 shares of a stock, you could buy a put option to protect yourself against a potential price drop.",
