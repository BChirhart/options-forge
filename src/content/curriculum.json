              "textContent": "The right, not the obligation (think: \"price\" insurance. Insuring the price of a stock)\n\nCore insight\n\nAn option is a paid right. You pay a premium today to lock in a guaranteed price you may use later—only if it helps you. That's why traders love them: your downside is capped at the cost of the premium, but you keep the choice on if you want to exercise the insurance policy or not.\n\nThe Insurance Analogy (that works for both buying and selling options)\n\nThere are two types of options: Calls (right to buy stock at a set price) and Puts (right to sell stock at a set price).\n\nCall = Price ceiling insurance (right to buy).\n\nYou pay the premium price to purchase a call to protect yourself from the stock running away. A call lets you buy at the strike price even if the market rips higher. If price doesn't rise? You don't have to buy—your worst case is the premium you paid. For example, if your option call strike price is $100 for ABC stock, and that stock jumps to $150 per share, you will have the right to purchase those shares at $100.\n\nPut = Price floor insurance (right to sell).\n\nYou pay to protect yourself from a drop. A put lets you sell at the strike price even if the market tanks. If price holds up? You don't have to sell—again, your worst case is the premium. For example, if your option put strike price is $100 for ABC stock, and that stock falls to $50, you will have the right to sell those shares at $100.\n\nOne sentence: Calls insure your maximum buy price for a stock; puts insure your minimum sell price for a stock.",
